<h1>Format Registry Browser, Version Dev02</h1>
<h2>The experiment</h2>
<p>This code is a demonstration of an experiment in browsing different file format
registries that provide <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html">Linked 
Data</a> through a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">SPARQL</a> endpoint.
Two major file format repositories — <a href="http://udfr.org/">UDFR</a> and 
<a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/">PRONOM</a> — claim to offer
such data. In addition, <a href="http://dbpedia.org/About">DBPedia</a>, a 
project of Wikipedia, has made its semi-structured infobox data, including data
on many file formats, available through SPARQL.
<p>
The code is less than elegant in places. I've put most of my effort into making
its purpose clear rather than refining its functionality. 
<a href="http://www.garymcgath.com">Current information on my status is here</a>
in case you want to contact me about it.
<p>
PRONOM is now supported.
There's code here for accessing Preserv2, but it's completely untested.
I suspect I should forget about it, as there appears to be no current work
on Preserv2 and the useful results probably went back into PRONOM. 
It's disabled by default and may disappear in a future version.
<p>
Comparing the DBPedia, PRONOM, and UDFR results shows that there will be difficulties
in combining results from different SPARQL sources. The nomenclature or
ontology is completely different, and so is the actual information
provided. There is no common technical language for describing file formats.
</p>
<h2>The application</h2>
<p>The Format Registry Browser is a Java Swing application requiring Java 5 or
higher. If you want to make changes, you'll need Apache Ant to rebuild
it. It incorporates several Apache libraries (Jena, Log4J, slf4j, and Xerces)
under the Apache 2.0 license and SLF4J under the MIT license. To run it,
just launch <code>bin/regbrowser.jar</code>.
Full source code is provided (if you have this file,
you should have it), including some JUnit tests. 
<p>
The application does a partial string match on the contents of all blank fields.
The comparison is case-insensitive. Characters which would mess up regular
expressions aren't allowed; this could be improved on. These are the following
characters: <br>
. &amp; [ ] ? * { } | \
<p>
This means that you can't put a period in when searching for an extension. Search for
"pdf", not ".pdf".
<p>
Javadoc is found in the <code>doc</code> directory.
<p>
Some configuration control is provided in 
<code>src/com/mcgath/regbrowser/config.properties</code>. By setting the value
of useDBPedia, useP2, and useUDFR to "y" or "n", you can select which registries
are queried. If you make changes, use ant to rebuild the application. You can also
set the logging level with the <code>logLevel</code> configuration variable.
<p>
This version tries to prettify results by doing the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Chopping off "@en" attribute markers. If any of the information is in languages
other than English, that's likely to be interesting, so it's left in.</li>
<li>Truncating URIs down to their final component, in the hope that it provides
a plausible name for the resource being referenced. </li>
<li>Eliminating double-caret ("^^") and everything after it, which usually
indicates the scheme of a value.
</ul>
<p>If you don't like these "improvements," just use the "Raw data" checkbox in
the query window.
<p>
I'd like to thank Andy Jackson, Chris Rusbridge, and Euan Cochrane for 
valuable discussion which led to this project, Peter May for publishing work on
SPARQL queries that was essential to my figuring out UDFR access, and
David Underdown for helping me to get PRONOM access to work.
