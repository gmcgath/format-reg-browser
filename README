The format metadata browser is an experiment in using SPARQL endpoints to
browse Linked Data on file formats from several sites. It's not a very
useful tool as it stands, but it can be mined for several purposes:

- Querying SPARQL sites using Jena (though I don't claim any great 
experience in writing SPARQL).

- Finding the SPARQL endpoints for PRONOM and UDFR. It took me some work 
just to find out their URLs.

- Developing ideas for extracting information from format registries.

Feel free to pull whatever you find useful out of this; credit would be
appreciated.

Building the project with ant creates a launchable JAR file in bin/rebrowser.jar
